# Rossman Store Sales Prediction 

This project involves building a predictive model for the Rossman Store Sales competition using a RandomForest algorithm. The model effectively handles large datasets and captures complex relationships within the data. Key features incorporated into the model include time series variables such as holidays, promotions, and weather conditions. By applying feature engineering and hyperparameter tuning, the model's forecasting accuracy was significantly enhanced.
